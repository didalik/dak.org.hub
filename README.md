Hi there, I'm Ð”Ñ–Ð´ Alik. I have a hobby project called [Stellar Help Exchange](https://github.com/amissine/shex/blob/main/README.md#presentation "Stellar HEX, work in progress"). To join it, use this repo. Clone it to your Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server and set it up to join our pool of hubs. The **Ð”Ñ–Ð´ Alik & the Kids** cloud-based organization welcomes you!
